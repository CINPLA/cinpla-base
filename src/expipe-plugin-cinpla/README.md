# Getting started

- make a github user [github](https://github.com/)
- download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) version 3.7, command line version
- download and install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- (optional) download and install [atom](https://atom.io/)

## Installation

Set up access to Norstore first:

- [Setup Norstore](https://github.com/CINPLA/expipe/wiki/Setup-Norstore)

Then follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

- [Installation on Linux](https://github.com/CINPLA/expipe/wiki/Installation-on-Linux)
- [Installation on Windows](https://github.com/CINPLA/expipe/wiki/Installation-on-Windows)

## Documentation

(old)
See the [wiki](https://github.com/CINPLA/expipe-plugin-cinpla/wiki/) or the [documentation](http://expipe-plugin-cinpla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
for more information on how to use expipe.

### Clone cinpla-base

First we need to clone the cinpla-base repository.
Open Github Desktop, hit Clone Repository --> URL --> paste `https://github.com/CINPLA/cinpla-base` and choose the folder in which you want to save this repository (you will need it later).
It is reccommended to create a new folder called `apps` in your local disk (not kant!).

### Get Anaconda ready

Open the Anaconda prompt and navigate to the cinpla-base folder (`cd path-to-cinpla-base` - e.g. `cd C:\\apps\cinpla-base`)

Now we need to create a new anaconda environment:

``` 
conda create -n expipe python=3.5
source activate expipe
```

If you plan to use electrophysiology and spike sorting also run this:

```
conda install pyqt=4
```

Then we can get all the python packages needed by:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now run expipe:
```
expipe
```

(in Windows, if it fails, run:
```
pip uninstall numpy
pip install numpy
```
and try again!)

### Clone the templates

Templates are used to create modules in expipe actions. Use github desktop to clone https://github.com/CINPLA/expipe-templates-cinpla.git.
This is a collection of templates used by the group that can be loaded into each project's templates folder.

### Create a project

The project will contain the data and relative information. You can make a folder called `data` or `projects`, for example, and create you projects there.

First change directory to your projects directory
```
cd path-to-data (or path-to-projects)
```

Then create a new project:
```
expipe create project_name
```

Now we can interact with the project by running:
```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a browser window (e.g. in Chrome). To create a new notebook (used to write and run code) press `New`-->`Python 3`. This will create an ipython notebook file (`.ipynb`).

In the first cell type and import the expipe packages:
```
from expipe_plugin_cinpla.widgets import browser
import expipe
```

In the second cell type:
```
browser.display('project_name')
```

This will display an interactive widget to register actions (such as surgery, adjustment, perfusion, recordings, analysis), entities (such as animals) and process them, and saving them in `exdir` format.

## Get started with spike sorting (SpikeInterface)

In order to process extracellular data

## Get started with Gitea

Gitea allows to handle large file sizes (LFS). We use NIRD to store those files at https://gitea.expipe.sigma2.no/
If you don't have an account contact Mikkel Lepper√∏d.

If you already created a project following the previous information, from the terminal go into the repository and type:
```
cd path-to-project
git init
```

Then you have to create a repository on Gitea with **the same name** by `Add repository`. Once this is done, you have to tell Gitea that the repository you created needs to be connected to your local repository. Copy the gitea url of your repository (e.g. https://gitea.expipe.sigma2.no/your-user-name/your-project-name.git) and run:

```
git remote add origin https://gitea.expipe.sigma2.no/your-user-name/your-project-name.git
```

Then we have to add the files that expipe created (actions, templates, modules, etc.).

```
expipe init-lfs
git add -A
git commit -m "loading first files (or any other message)"
git pull
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
git push
```
